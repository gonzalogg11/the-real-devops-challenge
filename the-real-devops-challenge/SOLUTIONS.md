Managed to run the application with the instructions given in the README file,
but it's not reading data from the mongodb. So I coded what I thought was right for fixing the second endpoint.

Added ci files in order to deploy the app in a jenkins server and push the image to an amazon web services cloud
environment and in a development cluster.

Simple dockerfile added too.
